NodeList:
---
- if there is one element with a class we can use "querySelector"
  - but if there are more than one element with same class.. we have to use "querySelectorAll"

- let's take an example of Modal Window to show how adding and removing of classes works
ex:
  <button class="show-modal">Show modal 1</button>
  <button class="show-modal">Show modal 2</button>
  <button class="show-modal">Show modal 3</button>

- document.querySelectorAll('.show-modal')... which gives a "NodeList"
  - NodeList is an 'array' type and consists of all arrays of elements

- so whenever we want to add/remove a class to an element.. we use {modal.classList.remove('hidden')}

  ex: <div class="modal hidden">
    - in order to remove a class from the above example we use
      - document.querySelector('.modal').classList.remove('hidden')

  ---same for adding--- document.querySelector('.modal').classList.add('hidden')

Note:
  - whenever we add a class to the classList we shall not put the (.) dot before the class we are adding to the element
  - same goes when adding a class to the element using DOM manipulation

keyboard events
--- How to handle key press events

- taking the above modal as an example, we can also close the modal using 'escape (esc)' key
   - so how to respond for keyboard events
- keyboard events are GLOBAL events.. that means we listen on whole document

- there are three types of events on keyboard.. they are
    1. key-down       - fired when press down a key
    2. key-up         - happens when we lift finger from a key
    3. key-press      - fired continuously, when we keep our finger on a certain key
